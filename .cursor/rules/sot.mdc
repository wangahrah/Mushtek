this is a godot4 project for a fantasy game.

for all prompts make sure the Godot Engine manual docs are in context, otherwise abort and prompt for them.

the story:

the setting is dystopian tech future + mycology - a fusion of plants and mushrooms.

the player navigates the world fighting enemies and solving puzzles, increasing their ability to craft + access to crafting items. there are few 'world' or 'inventory' items - the player can 'craft' on the fly different items for different slots:

hands
head
eyes
body
feet
accessory
 
different items in-slot of have different features - weapons have differnt characteristics, boots may run faster, allow walk on special terrain, eyes may allow darkvision or lazer attacks, etc.

player collects from various sources natoms of four tiers, allowing increasingly complex crafting. recipes have to be invented by scanning blueprints.

crafting the 'new' item is free, but there is a constant 'energy drain' of different natom tiers depending on complexity - ie simply headgear drains tier 1 natoms slowly and thats it, while the most complex may drain tier 4 natoms (and lower level)

basically, advancing -> getting more+higher level natoms, crafting higher tier gear, allowing more efficient natom collection.

ideally, the only 'inventory' we manage is natoms + tech unlocked.

it's relatively open world, with an overmap + dungeons.
